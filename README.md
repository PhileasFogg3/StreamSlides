# StreamSlides

## Installation
Just download the exe, pop it in a folder of your choice and run it :) All the files needed will be created.

## Use
<ul>
<li>
  The GUI is fairly simple I believe, but you can add different "slides" that contain text and then navigate between them, text can be bold, underlined and different colours. 
</li>
  <li>
    In Streamlabs OBS, create a Browser Source and point it at the local file "slide_output.html" - this should have been generated, you can find it in Documents/StreamSlides. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Then you're good to go! 
  </li>
</ul>

## Problems
Try disabling anti-virus if it doesn't like the file. 

## Future additions 
Idk! Make suggestions if you have them :) 

Any questions? Feel free to contact me :)
