# StreamSlides

## Installation
Just download the exe, pop it in a folder of your choice and run it :) All the files needed will be created.

## Use
<ul>
<li>
  The GUI is fairly simple I believe, but you can add different "slides" that contain text and then navigate between them, text can be bold, underlined and different colours. 
</li>
  <li>
    In Streamlabs OBS, create a Browser Source and point it at the local file "slide_output.html" - this should have been generated. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Then you're good to go! 
  </li>
</ul>

## Problems
Try disabling anti-virus if it doesn't like the file. 

## Future additions 
I plan to add "Slide Decks". This will enable to you swap and change between different text slides. Right now you can get around this by changing the name of "words.json". Only the file called "words.json" will be picked up by the program. 

Any questions? Feel free to contact me :)
